# Machine-Learning-Algorithms
Machine learning is the scientific study of algorithms and statistical models that computer systems use to perform a specific task without using explicit instructions, relying on patterns and inference instead. It is seen as a subset of artificial intelligence.
# List of common Machine Learning Algorithms are:
1. Linear Regression
2. Logistic Regression
3. Decision Tree
4. Random Forest
5. K-Nearest Neighbors
6. Support Vector Machine
7. Naive Baye's
8. K-Means Clustering
# Notes:
Here you can see the implementation of these algorithms by using Machine Learning techniques.
